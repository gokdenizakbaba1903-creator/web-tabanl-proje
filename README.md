## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This app was built to move away from boring, static note apps. By using **conic gradients** and a **drag-and-drop** system, the act of organizing notes becomes as fun as a match day! The folder structure ensures that while the look is "eylenceli" (fun), the utility remains professional.

## 🤝 Contributing
